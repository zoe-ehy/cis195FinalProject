# CIS195 Final Project: lost&found
Pennkey: zoeehy

Instead of listing lost and founds on a Penn Facebook group (or dm-ing upenn.memes on Instagram and asking him to post on his story), users can post their lost items in an Instagram-style feed way.

If their item is found, they can toggle the button in either the personal lost items view (first tab page) or the button in the map view (third tab page) to mark it as found, removing it off the home feed (second tab page) and the map view.
It remains in the personal lost items view but still marked as found as I feel like it is useful for the user to view their own history of lost items.

A new lost item post can be created by tapping the "+" button on the home feed.

# Future goals
- improve on the UI/UX, maybe by migrating the project to using SwiftUI
- implement a chat feature, so users can directly message each other if the item is found, instead of having to contact each other on a separate platform
- implement the same feed feature for items that are found by users but they don't know who the owner is
